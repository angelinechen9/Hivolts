# Hivolts
The objects of the Hivolts game are the player, twelve mhos, border electric fences, and twenty electric fences.  The player is Captain James T. Kirk, the mhos are Krall, and the electric fences are phasers.  The coordinates of the player, twelve mhos, and twenty electric fences are randomly placed.  When the player presses the keys, the player moves to an adjacent square or jumps to a random square, and the mhos move closer to the player.  If the player moves to an adjacent square, the player moves on an electric fence and loses, moves on a mho and loses, or moves on an empty square.  If player jumps to a random square, the player jumps on a mho and loses or jumps on an empty square.  If all of the mhos are removed from the game, the player wins.
